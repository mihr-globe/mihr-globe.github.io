things to maybe add or change / ask james if it's possible :^)

- globe orientation/view doesn't reset when swapping between default & borders
- toggling names instead of choosing one type at a time
    - maybe legend, idk if it's necessarily needed if types can be toggled anyway
- font borders
- dot marker on the side instead of above text where needed
    - possible to change the dots to a custom shape, like crowns for capitals or something
          - i guess i could do that by with alt codes or wingdings stars instead, but at least the latter would need a font change and i guess so would 
            the former, since simply copied alt code characters show up as ?s instead. looking at the character map the specific font used doesn't have 
            characters for anything fitting
- adding and/or changing size of segments (tiles?), alternatively/in addition better wrapping
- hidden way to toggle coordinate reference markers
- clicking on certain place names opens a map of said place on the side, although that'd take a lot of drawing so huge maybe
    - additionally/alternatively some info
