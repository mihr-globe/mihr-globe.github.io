things to maybe add or change / ask james if it's possible :^)

- globe orientation/view doesn't change when swapping between default & borders
- toggling names instead of choosing one type at a time
- maybe legend, idk if it's necessarily needed if types can be toggled anyway
- font borders
- dot marker on the side instead of above text where needed
- adding and/or changing size of segments (tiles?), alternatively/in addition better wrapping
- hidden way to toggle coordinate reference markers
